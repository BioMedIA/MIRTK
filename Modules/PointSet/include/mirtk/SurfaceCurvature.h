/**
 * Compute curvature at each point of a surface mesh
 *
 * This curvature computation is based on a robust estimation of the 3D curvature
 * tensor field as implemented in Matlab by Gabriel Peyre:
 *
 * http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-toolbox-graph/content/toolbox_graph/compute_curvature.m
 *
 * The algorithm is detailed in
 *       David Cohen-Steiner and Jean-Marie Morvan.
 *       Restricted Delaunay triangulations and normal cycle.
 *       In Proc. 19th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry,
 *       pages 237-246, 2003.
 *   and also in
 *       Pierre Alliez, David Cohen-Steiner, Olivier Devillers, Bruno LeÂŽvy, and Mathieu Desbrun.
 *       Anisotropic Polygonal Remeshing.
 *       ACM Transactions on Graphics, 2003.
 *       Note: SIGGRAPH '2003 Conference Proceedings
 *
 * Alternatively, the vtkCurvatures filter can be used to compute mean curvature,
 * Gauss curvature, and minimum and maximum curvature. To enable the use of this
 * VTK filter, call VtkCurvaturesOn(). This option is ignored when the curvature
 * tensor or principle directions are requested. If multiple curvature types
 * supported by vtkCurvatures are requested, the minimum and maximum curvatures
 * are computed by this filter from the mean and Gauss curvature values obtained
 * by vtkCurvatures, to avoid the duplicate computation of these curvature
 * values when using the vtkCurvatures filter. This computation is identical to
 * vtkCurvatures::GetMinimumCurvature and vtkCurvatures::GetMaximumCurvature.
