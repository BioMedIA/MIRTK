The Transformation module of the Medical Image Registration ToolKit (MIRTK)
defines the different transformation models supported by the |Registration|
module. These include linear homogeneous transformation types and non-rigid
free-form deformations. The Transformation module further includes a number
of transformation constraint terms which can be used to regularize the
registration problem.
