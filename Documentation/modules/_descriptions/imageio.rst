The Image I/O module of the Medical Image Registration ToolKit (MIRTK) enables the
reading and writing of image files. Supported file formats are GIPL, PGM, and
the `NIfTI file format <http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov>`__. Image slices can further
be written to PNG image files when the MIRTK was build WITH_PNG.
