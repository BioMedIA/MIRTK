The Point Set module of the Medical Image Registration ToolKit (MIRTK) adds
support for general point sets such as fidicual markers, surface meshes, and
volumetric tetrahedral meshes. It defines different auxiliary types used to
establish point correspondences between two given point sets/surface meshes.
These correpondences can be utilized by the |Registration| module to find a
transformation that aligns two given point sets.
