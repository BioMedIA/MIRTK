The Image module of the Medical Image Registration ToolKit (MIRTK) provides containers
and basic filters for imaging data sampled on a uniform grid. It contains image
interpolation functions which enable the evaluation of these finite discrete images
in an infinite continuous domain. This is in particular needed for the deformation of
an image during and after registration.
