Description
-----------

.. include:: _descriptions/register.rst



Arguments
---------

.. option:: -dofout <file>

   Write transformation to specified file.


Command options
---------------

.. option:: -model <m1>[+<m2>...]

   Transformation model(s). (default: Rigid+Affine+FFD)
   Alternatively, use "-par 'Transformation model' <name>" (see :option:`-par`).

.. option:: -image <file>...

   Input image to be registered. The order in which the images are
   given on the command-line corresponds to the image indices used
   in the registration energy formulation. The first input image has
   index 1 and is denoted by the symbol I(1) in the image similarity term.

.. option:: -pset <file>...

   Input points, curve(s), surface(s), or other simplicial complex(es).
   The order in which the point set files are given on the command-line
   corresponds to the point set indices used in the registration energy
   formulation. The first input point set has index 1 and is denoted by
   the symbol P(1), C(1), or S(1), respectively, in the point set distance
   measure (PDM) term.

.. option:: -dof <file>

   Specifies a pre-computed affine transformation to be applied to
   the preceeding image and/or polydata. Note the difference to :option:`-dofin`,
   which specifies an initial estimate of the :option:`-dofout` transformation.
   (default: none)

.. option:: -dof_i <file>

   Specifies a pre-computed affine transformation whose inverse is to be
   applied to the preceeding image and/or polydata (see :option:`-dof`). (default: none)

.. option:: -images <file>

   Text file with N lines containing the file names of each
   2D/3D input image, optionally followed by a space character and the
   associated (relative) acquisition time (in ms). If no acquisition
   time is given, the temporal offset of the image header is used.
   Images specified as positional arguments are read before the images
   named in this (then optional) text file and the index of the images
   given in the text file are offset by the number of images named
   as positional arguments or using :option:`-image`, respectively.

.. option:: -psets <file>

   Equivalent to :option:`-images`, but for point sets (:option:`-pset`).

.. option:: -dofs <file>

   Read names of affine transformations of input images from
   specified text file. The affine transformations are set as
   if the images had been transformed by these before. Hence,
   these transformations are not part of the output transformation.
   The text file must contain on each line the basename of the input image
   followed by the corresponding affine transformation file. Input images
   not included are assumed to not be further pre-transformed. (default: none)

.. option:: -mask <file>

   Reference mask which defines the domain within which to evaluate the
   energy function (i.e. image similarity). The registered images will
   thus be resampled within the corresponding domain of the world system.
   By default, the foreground of the target image defines this domain.

.. option:: -dofins <file>

   Read pairwise transformations from the files specified
   in the given text file which lists for each pair-wise
   transformation the corresponding target image, followed
   by the source image and the name of the transformation file.
   Note that the target and source image names must be listed
   in the :option:`-images` list file. (default: none)

.. option:: -dofin <file>

   Read initial transformation from file if :option:`-dofins` not specified.
   Otherwise, writes the initial transformation obtained by approximating
   the pairwise transformations to the named file.
   If the given transformation cannot be used directly as starting
   point of the registration, it will be approximated by an instance
   of the chosen transformation model at the initial resolution level.
   The input transformation may thus be of different type than the
   output transformation of the registration. (default: none)

.. option:: -par <name> <value>

   Specify parameter value directly as command argument.

.. option:: -parin <file>

   Read parameters from configuration file. If "stdin" or "cin",
   the parameters are read from standard input instead. (default: none)

.. option:: -parout <file>

   Write parameters to the named configuration file. Note that after
   initializaton of the registration, an interim configuration file is
   written. This file is overwritten once the registration finished with
   final configuration used during the course of the registration.
   (default: none)


Standard options
----------------

.. option:: -v, -verbose [n]

   Increase/Set verbosity of output messages. (default: 1)

.. option:: -debug [level]

   Increase/Set debug level for output of intermediate results. (default: 0)

.. option:: -version [major.minor]

   Print version and exit or set version to emulate.

.. option:: -revision

   Print revision (or version) number only and exit.

.. option:: -h, -help

   Print help and exit.


Terminal options
----------------

.. option:: -color, -nocolor

   Enable/disable colored output. (default: off)


Parallelization options
-----------------------

.. option:: -threads <n>

   Use maximal <n> threads for parallel execution. (default: automatic)
