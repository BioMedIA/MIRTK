This tool computes a mapping for each point on the surface of a given input shape
embedded in 3D space. The output is a (piecewise linear) function which assigns each
point on the surface of the input shape one or more values. In case of non-closed surfaces,
the output map can interpolate any values given on the boundary of the surface at the
interior points of the surface. More common use cases are to compute a bijective mapping
from one geometric shape to another geometric shape with identical topology. The resulting
map is a parameterization of the surface of the input shape. Such parameterization can be
used for texturing, object morphing, and surface registration.
