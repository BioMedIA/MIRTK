Merge surface meshes at segmentation label boundaries. The input
surfaces must follow closely the boundary of a segment in the given
image segmentation. Two surfaces are then merged at the longest
common intersection boundary. When the two surfaces share no such
segmentation boundary, the surfaces are not connected.
