.. Auto-generated by help-rst from "mirtk invert-dof -h" output


Inverts any transformation. In case of a non-rigid transformation
the output transformation only approximates the true inverse.
When the inverse mapping is not defined at a given point, the
output transformation at this point depends on the interpolation
numerical approximate solution found.
