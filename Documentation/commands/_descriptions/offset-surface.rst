.. Auto-generated by mirtk-help-rst from "mirtk offset-surface -h" output


Displaces surface mesh points by a given amount along the surface normal
to create an offset surface mesh. To prevent self-intersections, a dense
offset surface can optionally first be sampled from an implicit offset
surface model onto which each point of the input surface is projected.

Another use of this tool is to enforce a minimum distance between two
surface meshes such as in particular the inner (WM/cGM) and outer (cGM/CSF)
cortical surfaces. Points of the <input> surface are displaced if they
are closer than the allowed offset distance to the second surface.
