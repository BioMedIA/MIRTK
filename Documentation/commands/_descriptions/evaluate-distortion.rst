.. Auto-generated by help-rst from "mirtk evaluate-distortion -h" output


Computes the distortion of a surface mesh under deformation, when
mapped to the surface of another solid with equivalent topology, or
flattened to the plane or sphere, respectively.

The distortion measures are stored as point/cell data of the output
dataset. If no output file name is given, the mean and standard deviation
are reported even when the verbose option -v is not given.
