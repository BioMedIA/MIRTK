This tool parameterizes a shape embedded in 3D space. The generated output
map assigns each point in the input domain a point in the output domain.

The input domain is defined either by the convex hull of an input point
cloud or a surface mesh delineating the boundary of the domain, or a volumetric
data set such as a tetrahedral mesh. Furthermore, this tool can parameterize
common primitive shapes such as a sphere by either triangulating its surface
or creating a tetrahedral mesh of its interior. A triangulated boundary surface
generated with this tool can subsequently be mapped to the boundary of the desired
output domain. Such boundary map can then be extended into the interior of the
input domain to generate a volumetric map.

The output is by default either the tesselation of the target point set
or, when a volumetric map to a source domain is computed, the target point
set (or tesselation of the target volume) with the corresponding volumetric
map coordinates as point data. When the -map option is given, the coefficients
of the volumetric map itself are written to a binary output file. This map can
later applied to the target or another point set using the -apply option.
