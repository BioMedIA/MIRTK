.. Auto-generated by help-rst from "mirtk transform-points -h" output


Applies one or more transformations to a set of points. Input point
x, y, and z coordinates are either read from STDIN (space separated) or from a
point set file. The corresponding transformed coordinates are then written
either to STDOUT or an output point set file, respectively. If multiple
transformations are specified, these are applied in the order as they appear
on the command line.

    Attention: When both :option:`transform-points -target` and :option:`transform-points -source` arguments are given,
               the points are first mapped from target world to image space and then
               the image to world transformation of the source image is applied.
               This is a relict from the corresponding IRTK command...
