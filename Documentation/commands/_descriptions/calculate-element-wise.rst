.. Auto-generated by help-rst from "mirtk calculate-element-wise -h" output


This tool can be used for basic calculations from a sequence of data values read
either from an image or a VTK pointset. It can be used, for example, to add two
data sequences and to divide the result by a constant. The current sequence can
be written to an output file again using :option:`calculate-element-wise -out`. Additionally, statistics
of the current data sequence can be computed such as the mean or variance.
The order of the data transformations and calculation of statistics is determined
by the order of the command-line arguments.

The data mask is used to include/exclude values from subsequent operations.
Initially, all NaN values in the input data sequence are excluded.
Further values can be excluded using one or more of the masking operations.
Using the mask, operations can be performed on only a subset of the data,
and the mask then reset using :option:`calculate-element-wise -reset-mask`.

By default, data statistics are printed to STDOUT in a human readable format.
This output can be appended to a text file using :option:`calculate-element-wise -append` instead.
For a more machine readable output, e.g., as comma separated values (CSV),
specify a delimiting string using :option:`calculate-element-wise -delimiter`. In this case, a header
line is also printed when :option:`calculate-element-wise -header` is given with optional user
specified column names for the individual output values.
