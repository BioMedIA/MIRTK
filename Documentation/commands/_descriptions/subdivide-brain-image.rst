.. Auto-generated by help-rst from "mirtk subdivide-brain-image -h" output


This program reads a structural brain segmentation and derives from it
a segmentation of the brain volume into the following output labels.
This output segmentation can then be used to reconstruct topologically
correct (i.e., closed genus-0) surfaces of the cGM/WM interface for the
left and right hemisphere, where subcortical and deep brain structures
are enclosed by these so-called white surfaces. Additionally, the
brainstem+cerebellum segment can be respresented by another closed
surface mesh. The union of these reconstructured surfaces encloses
the entire brain volume, yet excluding cortical grey matter.
By deforming the joint brain surface towards the cGM/CSF interface,
the pial surface which encloses the entire brain volume including
subcortical structures can be obtained. The right/left hemisphere
assignment of cortical grey matter follows from the point correspondences
between white and pial surfaces, respectively, the RH/LH label may
be assigned to white surface mesh nodes upon merging the right/left
white surface meshes. See merge-surfaces -source-array option.

Output labels:
- 0: Background
- 1: Cortical grey matter
- 2: Cerebral white matter and deep brain structures of right hemisphere
- 3: Cerebral white matter and deep brain structures of left  hemisphere
- 4: Brainstem, including cerebellum when :option:`subdivide-brain-image -brainstem-and-cerebellum` is on
- 5: Cerebellum, when :option:`subdivide-brain-image -brainstem-and-cerebellum` is off
