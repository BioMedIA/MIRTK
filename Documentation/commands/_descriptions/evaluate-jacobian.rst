.. Auto-generated by mirtk-help-rst from "mirtk evaluate-jacobian -h" output


Computes the Jacobian determinant of the given transformation at
each target image voxel. If no <output> image name is given,
the statistics of the Jacobian determinant distribution are printed
to STDOUT instead, such as min, max, and mean.

By default, the output Jacobian determinant map has integral voxel type
with Jacobian determinant values scaled by 100 prior to casting.
Use either option :option:`evaluate-jacobian -float` or :option:`evaluate-jacobian -double` to output the
unscaled determinants.
