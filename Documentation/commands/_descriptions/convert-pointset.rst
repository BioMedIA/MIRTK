Convert point set from one (file) format to another.

If more than one input point sets is given, all input point sets
are appended into a single point set before conversion. When all
input point sets are of type vtkPolyData, the output point set
is of type vtkPolyData. If more than one input point set is given
and not all are of type vtkPolyData, the output point set is of type
vtkUnstructuredGrid.

The current implementation can only convert between different
point set file formats based on the file name extension.
Besides the common formats supported by VTK, it can also read/write
BrainSuite .dfs files and write a Piecewise Linear Complex (PLC)
B-Rep description in the TetGen formats .poly and .smesh. It also
supports the Object File Format (.off) used by the CGAL library.
