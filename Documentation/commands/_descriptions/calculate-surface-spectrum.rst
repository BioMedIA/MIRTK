Performs a spectral analysis of the general graph Laplacian matrix
computed from the given input surface mesh(es).

If :option:`calculate-surface-spectrum -target` surface is specified, the eigenvectors are reordered
and their sign flipped to match the eigenvectors of the target surface mesh.

If two input and output surface meshes are specified, a spectral analysis
of the joint graph Laplacian is performed after an initial surface match.
The type of initial point correspondences is defined by :option:`calculate-surface-spectrum -corr`.

The implementation is based on the MATLAB code by Herve Lombaert of [1]_.
