.. Auto-generated by help-rst from "mirtk combine-images -h" output


Concatenate two or more either 2D images to form a 3D volume,
or 3D volumes to form a 3D+t temporal sequence. All input images
must have the same image attributes, except in either the third (2D)
or the third and fourth (3D) image dimension.

Moreover, given an :option:`combine-images -input` volume (sequence), additional
slices (volumes) can be appended to it. Note that when :option:`combine-images -sort`
is enabled, the additional slices (volumes) can be interleaved with the
existing volume (sequence), allowing inserting a slice (volume) anywhere
not only after the last slice (volume) of the input volume (sequence).

Note that the slice thickness of the output volume when concatenating slices
is set equal the average slice thickness of the input images, unless it is
overridden by the :option:`combine-images -spacing` value.
