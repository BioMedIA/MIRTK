Calculates registration transformation quality measures such as the voxel-wise
cumulative or mean inverse-consistency error (CICE/MICE) for pairs of forward
transformation from target to source and backward transformation from source
to target image. Another voxel-wise measure that can be computed using this
program are the cumulative or mean transitivity error (CTE/MTE) given three
transformations, from target (A) to B, from B to C, and from C to A again.

This tool can further be used to evaluate the deviation of N affine transformations
which map a template to each one of N images from the barycenter corresponding
to the identity transformation. A larger deviation indicates a stronger bias of
the template towards a subset of the images and/or unbalanced registration errors.
