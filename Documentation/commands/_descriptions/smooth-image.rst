This program blurs an input image using a Gaussian filter with a standard
deviation equal to the specified sigma value. The dimensions in which the
filter recursively applied can be specified by the respective options below.
Note that more than one of these options can be specified and that each can
also be given more than once. The blurring of the respective dimensions
is then performed in the order of the given blurring options.

The output image is by default saved as short integers if the
input image was of integral voxel type, otherwise as float image.
