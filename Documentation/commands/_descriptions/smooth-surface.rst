Smooths the node positions and/or scalar data of a surface mesh.

When node positions are smoothed, iteratively move mesh nodes towards the
centroid of the adjacent nodes. The relaxation factor (RF) determines how
far each node moves towards the local centroid (0 <= lambda <= 1). The new position
of a node is a weighted combination of its previous position and the neighbours' centroid.
If lambda = 1, a node is moved all the way to the centroid, while lambda = 0 keeps a node
at its previous position.

For a low-pass filtering of the surface mesh, set :option:`smooth-surface -lambda` to a positive value in
the range (0, 1), and :option:`smooth-surface -mu` to a negative value greater in magnitude than
lambda, i.e., 0 < lambda < mu. For a detailed explanation of the parameters,
cf. Taubin, Curve and Surface Smoothing without Shrinkage, ICCV 1995.
