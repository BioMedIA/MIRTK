Registers a set of images, polygonal surface meshes, and/or point clouds (e.g. fiducial markers).
The set of input images can be comprised of multiple channels (e.g., acquired with different imaging
modalities) at different time points. For longitudinal data, the temporal origin in the NIfTI header
identifies the time point that each input image belongs to. How all input images and polydata sets are
registered with one another is determined by an energy function. This energy function is formulated in
a simplified math expression using MATLAB-style indexing for the individual input files, i.e.,

::

    Energy function =      SIM[Image dissimilarity](I(1), I(2:end) o T)...
                    +      PDM[Point set distance](T o P(1), P(2:end))...
                    + 1e-3 BE[Bending energy](T)...
                    +    0 LE[Linear energy](T)...
                    +    0 TP[Topology preservation](T)...
                    +    0 VP[Volume preservation](T)...
                    +    0 LogJac[LogJac penalty](T)...
                    +    0 NegJac[NegJac penalty](T)...
                    +    0 Sparsity(T)

where only energy terms with non-zero weights are active during the registration.
The image dissimilarity term is only added if at least two input images are given.
Similarly, only with at least two input polydata sets, the PDM term is added.
These energy terms are referenced in the configuration file using their respective
identifier in square brackets. For example, to change the weight of the bending energy
smoothness term, add "Bending energy weight = 0.01" to the configuration file or
use the -par option on the command-line. To enable volume preservation, set the
parameter "Volume preservation weight" to a positive value.
