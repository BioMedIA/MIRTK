.. Auto-generated by help-rst from "mirtk init-dof -h" output


This tool either creates a new affine transformation with the given parameters
or approximates an affine transformation or non-rigid deformation given
a set of corresponding landmarks or point displacements (see :option:`init-dof -displacements`).

The output transformation is by default an affine transformation.
One of the output options below can be used to request a different
type of output transformation. This option should be given right
after the output transformation name as it may be altered using
one of the other output related options (e.g. disable :option:`init-dof -shearing`).

An affine transformation is the composition of a shearing followed by
a scaling, a rotation, and a translation. The homogeneous transformation
matrix, A, is given by the matrix product:

.. math::

   A = Translate * Rotate * Scale * Shear, where Rotate = (Rz Ry Rx)^T
