   This program blurs an input image using a Gaussian filter with a standard
   deviation equal to the specified sigma value. The dimensions in which the
   filter recursively applied can be specified by the respective options below.

   also be given more than once. The blurring of the respective dimensions
   is then performed in the order of the given blurring options.
