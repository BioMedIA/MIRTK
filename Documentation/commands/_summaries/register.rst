   Registers a set of images, polygonal surface meshes, and/or point clouds (e.g. fiducial markers).
   The set of input images can be comprised of multiple channels (e.g., acquired with different imaging
   modalities) at different time points. For longitudinal data, the temporal origin in the NIfTI header
   identifies the time point that each input image belongs to. How all input images and polydata sets are
   registered with one another is determined by an energy function. This energy function is formulated in
   a simplified math expression using MATLAB-style indexing for the individual input files, i.e.,
