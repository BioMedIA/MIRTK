   Merge surface meshes at segmentation label boundaries. The input
   surfaces must follow closely the boundary of a segment in the given
   image segmentation. Two surfaces are then merged at the longest
   common intersection boundary. When the two surfaces share no such
   segmentation boundary, the surfaces are not connected.
