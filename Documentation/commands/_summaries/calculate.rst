   This tool can be used for basic calculations from a sequence of data values read
   either from an image or a VTK pointset. It can be used, for example, to add two
   data sequences and to divide the result by a constant. The current sequence can
   be written to an output file again using :option:`calculate -out`. Additionally, statistics
   of the current data sequence can be computed such as the mean or variance.
   The order of the data transformations and calculation of statistics is determined
   by the order of the command-line arguments.
