   This tool computes a mapping for each point of the volume of a given input point set.
   The input is either a piecewise linear complex (PLC), i.e., a tesselation of the surface,
   or a tesselation of the shape's volume such as a tetrahedral mesh generated from a PLC.
   The output is a volumetric map which assigns points of the volume one or more values.
   The volumetric map can in general interpolate any values given on the surface of the map
   domain at the interior of the volume. More common use cases are to compute a bijective
   map from one volumetric shape to another with identical topology. The resulting map is a
   re-parameterization of the volume of the input shape. Such parameterization can be used for
   texturing, object deformation (cf. "cage deformation"), object morphing, and surface-
   constraint image registration.
