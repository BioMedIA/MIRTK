   This program reads a structural brain segmentation and derives from it
   a segmentation of the brain volume into the following output labels.
   This output segmentation can then be used to reconstruct topologically
   correct (i.e., closed genus-0) surfaces of the cGM/WM interface for the
   left and right hemisphere, where subcortical and deep brain structures
   are enclosed by these so-called white surfaces. Additionally, the
   brainstem+cerebellum segment can be respresented by another closed
   surface mesh. The union of these reconstructured surfaces encloses
   the entire brain volume, yet excluding cortical grey matter.
   By deforming the joint brain surface towards the cGM/CSF interface,
   the pial surface which encloses the entire brain volume including
   subcortical structures can be obtained. The right/left hemisphere
   assignment of cortical grey matter follows from the point correspondences
   between white and pial surfaces, respectively, the RH/LH label may
   be assigned to white surface mesh nodes upon merging the right/left
   white surface meshes. See merge-surfaces -source-array option.
