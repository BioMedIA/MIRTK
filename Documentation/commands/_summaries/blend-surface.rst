.. |blend-surface-brief-description| replace::

   Blends two surface meshes with index based one-to-one point correspondences
   by taking the point coordinates for selected points from the first surface
   mesh and all others from the second surface mesh. Points at the boundary of
   the point selection mask are blended between the two mesh positions of the
   corresponding points. For other points, i.e., those further away from the
   boundary, the blending factor is either 0 or 1.
