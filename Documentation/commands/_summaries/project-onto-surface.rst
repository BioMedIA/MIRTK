   Assign scalars or labels to either the vertices or the cells of a surface mesh.
   When the input as a real-valued image, the values are linearly interpolated.
   When the input is a segmentation labels image, the value assigned to a vertex/cell
   is the label of the nearest voxel in the given segmentation image. For the projection
   of cortical labels onto the WM/cGM or cGM/CSF boundary, use :option:`project-onto-surface -white` or :option:`project-onto-surface -pial`.
