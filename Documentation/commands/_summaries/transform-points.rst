.. |transform-points-brief-description| replace::

   Applies one or more transformations to a set of points. Input point
   x, y, and z coordinates are either read from STDIN (space separated) or from a
   point set file. The corresponding transformed coordinates are then written
   either to STDOUT or an output point set file, respectively. If multiple
   transformations are specified, these are applied in the order as they appear
   on the command line.
