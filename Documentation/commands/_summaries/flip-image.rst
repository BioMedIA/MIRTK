.. |flip-image-brief-description| replace::

   Swaps the two image dimensions at a time, in the order of the input
   options. Both, the image data and the coordinates of the image origin
   are swapped each time an input option is processed. To swap the image
   axes instead of the origin, use the :option:`flip-image -axes` option before the
   swap options. This option should be used to reorder the image dimensions
   without changing the world coordinates of the voxels. When swapping of
   the coordinate axes is enabled, the coordinates of the image origin are
   kept the same, i.e., :option:`flip-image -origin` is ignored. The default behavior
   is to swap the image data and the coordinates of the image origin. This
   may in many cases not have the desired effect, but has been this way
   already for some time.
