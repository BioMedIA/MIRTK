   Calculates registration transformation quality measures such as the voxel-wise
   cumulative or mean inverse-consistency error (CICE/MICE) for pairs of forward
   transformation from target to source and backward transformation from source
   to target image. Another voxel-wise measure that can be computed using this
   program are the cumulative or mean transitivity error (CTE/MTE) given three
   transformations, from target (A) to B, from B to C, and from C to A again.
