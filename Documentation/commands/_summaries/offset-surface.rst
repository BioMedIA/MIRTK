.. |offset-surface-brief-description| replace::

   Displaces surface mesh points by a given amount along the surface normal
   to create an offset surface mesh. To prevent self-intersections, a dense
   offset surface can optionally first be sampled from an implicit offset
   surface model onto which each point of the input surface is projected.
