   Crop/pad image by extracting a region of interest and optionally split  the extracted region into separate image files, e.g., individual slices  of a volume saved as individual image files. The output image region
   is chosen such that it contains the union of all specified axis-aligned
   rectangular input image regions. In case of :option:`extract-image-region -pad`, the output
   region does not have to be fully contained within the input image.
   Values outside are then set to the specified padding value.
